# CPU/GPU Based Prover for zkSync Era

[![Logo](eraLogo.svg)](https://zksync.io/)

zkSync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or
decentralization. Since it's EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring
or re-auditing a single line of code. zkSync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers
write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.
